# Serverless Shopify App on Architect

> An embedded Shopify admin application you can build locally and deploy to AWS with [Architect](https://arc.codes).

## What you get:

- [Merchant OAuth](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/oauth) with permanent access token retrieval
- [Shopify App Bridge Connection](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/app-bridge)
- [Session token validation via App Bridge](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/session-tokens/app-bridge-utilities)
- [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/cli) compatibility (wrapped around [`@architect/sandbox`]())

### Not included:

- React, [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/), or any front end tooling
- a datastore connection (though, that's easy with `arc`)
- Rails
- actual batteries üîã

## Status: WIP

## Getting started

### Required

- knowledge of Node.js and Architect (or at least what "serverless" is)
- from Shopify
  - partner account
  - development store
  - admin app credentials
  - CLI installed

### Building locally üèóÔ∏è

1. clone
1. create `.env` (see `.env.sample`)
1. configure `.shopify-cli.yml`
1. `shopify node connect`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm test`
1. `shopify node serve` runs `npm start` and provides a tunnel
1. install the app to the dev store with link provided by Shopify CLI
1. do work

## Development to do

- /api/ping should connect to Shopify Admin API with [the official Node client](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-node-api) and return results
- test session validation
- document:
  - why this approach
  - improve "Getting started" docs
    - Shopify CLI + `arc`
  - adding `arc` resources
    - @http + @events would help demonstrate how to handle webhooks
  - ~~deploying~~ (out of scope)
