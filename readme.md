# Serverless Shopify App on Architect

> An embedded Shopify admin application you can build locally and deploy to AWS with [Architect](https://arc.codes).

## What you get

- [Merchant OAuth](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/oauth) with permanent access token retrieval
- [Shopify App Bridge Connection](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/app-bridge)
- [Session token validation via App Bridge](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/session-tokens/app-bridge-utilities)
- [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/cli) compatibility (wrapped around [`@architect/sandbox`]())

## Not included

- React, [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/), or any front end tooling
- a datastore connection (though, that's easy with `arc`)
- Rails
- actual batteries üîã

## Status: WIP

## Next Steps

- /api/ping should connect to Shopify Admin API with [the official Node client](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-node-api) and return results
- test session validation
- document:
  - why this approach
  - getting set up locally
    - Shopify CLI + `arc`
  - adding `arc` resources
    - @http + @events would help demonstrate how to handle webhooks
  - deploying (probably out of scope)
